\section{Introduction}

Netcompany is a danish IT consultancy company. It has more than 7000 employees in 6 different countries\footnote{See \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcompany} (Wikipedia, accessed July 2, 2025).}, where I will be an intern from start February to end of June.

\say{De primære arbejdsopgaver er at udføre programmeringsopgaver o. lign. for Netcompany.}\footnote{From my trainee contract with Netcompany.}

I want to become a professional software engineer. In this report I will summarize my experiences as an intern at Netcompany, working full-time, and evaluate whether this internship has given me the skills necessary to be a good professional software engineer.



\section{Problem Statement and Tasks}

I have had three big tasks I have solved when working as a software engineering intern at Netcompany. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Building an Admin Panel for \href{https://nationaltforsoegsoverblik.dk/}{National Forsøgsoverblik} 
    \item Add new code to implement law from government for Sagbehandlingssystem for Socialstyrelsen (SOCVIAS) regarding Greenland
    \item Moving PDF creation from frontend to backend in Henvendelsesformen
\end{itemize}

In this section I will describe what the challenges of each of these problems were. 

\subsection{National Forsøgsoverblik}

This was my first assignment. I was completely new at Netcompany. I was instructed to build an admin panel from scratch, and had very free reigns on how to do it. 

There was a word document describing the problems we were solving, but how to do it was up to me. The codebase was in Java in the backend, and Angular for the frontend. 

I knew Java very well, but I had never even looked at Angular code before. The framework Angular does however have some similarity with the javascript library React, with which I have worked quite a bit.


The challenges I faced were:
\begin{itemize}
    \item New language, Angular
    \item New workplace, what is the workflow, who can I ask for help?
    \item Security, how can I make sure the Admin panel is only accessed by authenticated and authorized users?
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Social- og Boligstyrelsen}
SOCBS(Social- og Boligstyrelsen) needed to implement some new functionality in their internal systems for handling cases related to Greenland, since "Folketinget" had passed a new law. This law gave people on Greenland some additional support to apply for through SOCBS which means they needed to be able to create cases in their systems for budget and case history reasons.

It was difficult, because the codebase is enourmous, over 200.000 LOC(Lines Of Code). One person at work knows it well, but even he admits that there are parts of the code he has never seen, and even less understands.

The solution is temporary, so it should be implemented as quick and cheap as possible. From 1st of August, there will be many more changes, so this is just a temporary fix until then.




The challenges were:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An enormous amount of legacy Java code, more than 200.000 LOC
    \item SECURITY PROBLEM html sanitization 
    \item Add new code to implement law from government for Sagbehandlingssystem for Socialstyrelsen (SOCVIAS) 
    \item Restructure and untangle frontend's pdf handling and submission Henvendelsesformen to be easier to work with
\end{itemize}

%IN MORE DETAIL describe problems and tasks 

These are some of the big tasks I have worked on when doing my internship at Netcompany.

\begin{itemize}
    \item https://nationaltforsoegsoverblik.dk/ 
    \item SECURITY PROBLEM html sanitization 
    \item Add new code to implement law from government for Sagbehandlingssystem for Socialstyrelsen (SOCVIAS) 
    \item Restructure and untangle frontend's pdf handling and submission Henvendelsesformen to be easier to work with
\end{itemize}

In this section I will describe what the task was and the problems we encountered. 


The first one is available to the public, and the second one is an internal system for Socialstyrelsen, to make budgets and work with the private sector. 

\subsection{Henvendelsesformen}
One task I worked on here was changing the frontend of this multi-step form. 



\section{Company Overview}
En beskrivelse af virksomheden, forretningsgrundlag og organisation 

Netcompany is Denmark's biggest IT consultancy firm.
They deliver IT solutions to big businesses and governments, mostly in northern Europe.
They have more than 7000 employees. It was founded in 1999. 

Netcompany is broadly divided in to two types of teams.
Project delivery teams that build and implement new things, and long-term service teams that support long-term applications

There is no hard divide between software development and operating the software, DevOps. Teams are expected to handle both for their applications. 

I am an intern at the APS (Application Services) division of Netcompany.
Originally, APS were only tasked with maintaining existing software, that either came from the outside or that the consultancy division wanted to handover.
Sometimes there are new projects in APS, but that is usually a smaller part of a larger project that is being maintained.  

Netcompany has a Methodology that is called Agile with control. Agile aims to avoid planning to far ahead, since you can not know what will happen far in to the future.
Since many projects are done together with state actors, who demand long term planning, Netcompany tries to do agile, while also satisfying client demands.
