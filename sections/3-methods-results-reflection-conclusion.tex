\section{Internship Reflection}
\label{sec:reflection}

When working with IT, there are many competing ideas about what we do. We write
code, we solve problems and we try to write efficient algorithms, and clean, easy to maintain code. However, is that the point of programming? 

\say{Software is a just a tool to help accomplish something for people - many software engineers never understood that. Keep your eyes on the delivered value, and don't over focus on the specifics of the tools.}\footnote{John Carmack, ID Software, one of the creators of Doom and Quake}

These are the words of a software engineer who is  widely regarded as one of the most proficient in the world.
